As my final year project, I wanted to solve a problem that we as college students faced regarding sharing of study material, important notes and most importantly learning from each other.
From books to knowledge, everything was fragmented so I wanted to create a platform for inclusive sharing and healthy discussion.
This led me to create an online peer-to-peer, e-learning platform where students make study material accessible.
